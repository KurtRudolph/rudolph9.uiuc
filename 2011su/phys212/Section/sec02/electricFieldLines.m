% (a)
% The configuration at the right shows some points around a psositive charge $Q$. If a positive test charge $q$ is placed at point $A$, at distance $r_A$ form $Q$, calculate the magnitude of the force between the charges in terms the given varibles.  
%Draw the direction of the force with an arrow on the diagram.

abs( F_A) =  k*q*Q/(r_A)^2

% (b)
% Would the magnitude of the force e bigger or smaller if the charge was placed at polints B,C, or D?
% Draw the direction of these forces on the diagram with arrows, using the lengths of the arrows to indicate the relative magnitude of the forces.

abs( F_B) > abs( F_C) > abs( F_D)


% (c) 
% On the diagram at right, draw extended electric field lines for $Q$.  What feature of these lines indicates the relative magnitude of the fields at $A$ and $B$.  

abs( F_B) > abs( F_B) > abs( F_C) > abs( F_D)

% (d)
% Calculate the magnitue fo the electric field at point $A$, in terms of given variables.

abs( E_A)  = k*Q/(r_A)^2

% If $Q$ is doubles, what is the new value of the electric ield at $A$?  If $q$ is doubled insted, what is the new value of the field at $A$?

%double Q
abs( E_A) = k*2*Q/(r_A)^2

%doubel q

abs( E_A)  = k*Q/(r_A)^2


% (e) 
% The region in the box at right contains a uniform electric field, $E$.  A test charge $q$ is placed in the box.  Compare the magnitude of the field at points $A$ and $B$.  Write an expression for the force the test charge feels at point $A$.

 F_A = q * E

% (f)
% The regiion in the box at right contains a non-uniform electric field.  Compare the magnitudes of the field at $A$, $B$, and $C$.  If test charges of equal magnitudes (and masses) are placed at $B$ and $C$, which one is push ot of the box firest?  

E_A > E_B > E_C 
%B is pushed out first
