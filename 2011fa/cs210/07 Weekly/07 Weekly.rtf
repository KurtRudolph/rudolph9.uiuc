\f0\fs26 \cf0 Refer to Chapter 5. Look at the arguments about whether or not individuals should be permitted to remain anonymous in cyberspace. Should people always take responsibility for their words and actions? Are there circumstances where anonymity is justifiable and important? Explain how your own viewpoint is firmly rooted in ethics. Use examples to back up your arguments. You might want to use blogs, responses to blogs, and responses to news items as examples.\
\
Weather or not an individual should be able to remain anonymous in cyberspace depends on the circumstances.  If this is a government portal acting acting as a publicly provided service, this is a situation where an individual should be able to remain anonymous.  In the case of a random blog site, should the owner of the blog site decide to allow persons to be anonymous than the person who post should have the ability to keep their identities hidden.  }
