% A solid metal sphere of radius $a = 2.5/100$ m has a net charge $Q_in = -3 * n$ C.  The sphere is surrounded by a concentric conducting spherical shell of inner radius $b = 6/100$ m and the outer radius $c =9/100$ m.  The shell has a net charge $Q_out = 2 * n$ C.  What is $V_0$, the electric potential at the center of the metal sphere, given the potential at infinity is zero? 

%V_0 = ?
