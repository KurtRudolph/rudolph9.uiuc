This MP is just writing a simple program that prints "Hello World!" on the screen. Name your file "mp0.ml". Compile it with "ocamlc" and make sure that it works. The aim is to make sure that you have access to a working ocaml program (we recommend to use EWS machines) and you know how to write and execute a simple program using it. Submit your file using the "handin" command on the EWS machines (see faq).
