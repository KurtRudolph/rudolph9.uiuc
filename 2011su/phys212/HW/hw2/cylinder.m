% Two coaxial cylindrical conductors are shown in perspective and cross-sction above.  The inner cylinder
% has radius $a = 2$ cm, length $L = 10$ m and carries a total charge of $q_inner = 8$ nc (1 nC = 10^(-9)C).  The 
%outer cylinder has an inner radius $b = 6 cm%, outer radius $c = 7$ cm, length $L = 10$ m and carries a total
%charge of $Q_outer = -16$.  What is $E_x$, the x-component of the electric field at point $P$ 
%whih is located at the midpoint of the length of the cylinders at a distance $r = 4$ cm from the origin and 
%makes an angle of 30 degrees with the x-axis?
