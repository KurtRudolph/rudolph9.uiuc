This README file accompanies the 2011/03/02 version of the "acmsiggraph"
LaTeX and BibTeX files, to be used to prepare documents for publication in
the print and electronic proceedings of events sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH.

Please examine the "template.tex" file carefully, especially if you have
used the "acmsiggraph" class files before. There are several new commands,
and several commands have been (appropriately) moved out of the LaTeX file
and into the "acmsiggraph.cls" template file.

Questions, comments and suggestions should be sent to Stephen Spencer
at 'spencer@cs.washington.edu' to be considered for inclusion in a future
version of this package.
