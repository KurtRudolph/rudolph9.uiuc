% An infinite line of charge with charge density $lambda_1 = 0.4 mu$ C/cm is aligned with the y-axis as shown

% 1) What is E_x(P), the value of the x-component of the electric field produced by the line of chare at point $P$ which is located at $(x,y) = (a,0)$, where $a = 8.5$ cm?  

lambda_1 = 0.4 * mu % C/cm
a = 8.5  %cm
P = [a; 0]

% 3) A cylinder of radius $a = 8.5$ cm and height $h = 9.3$ cm is aligned with its axis along the y-axis as shown.  What is the total flux $phi$ that passes through the cylindrical surface?  Enter a positive number if the net flux leaves the cylinder and a negative number if the net flux enters the cylnder.
