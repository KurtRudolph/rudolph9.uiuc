% A metal sphere of radius $a = 1.5$ m is centered on the origin, and carries a total charge $Q_sphere = -5 * mu$ C.  Surrounding the sphere is a spherical metal shell of inner radius $b = 3$ m and outer radius $c = 4.5$ m.  This shell is also centered on the origin, and carries a total charge $Q_shell = 2 * mu$ C.  
a = 1.5 %m
Q_sphere = -5 * mu %C
b = 3 %m
c = 4.5 %m 
Q_shell = 2 * mu %C

% 1) What is the ptential difference $V_a - V_c$ between the surface of the metal shere ($r = a$) and the outer surface of the metal shell ($r=c$)?  

% 2) Tow point charges $q_1 = 2 * mu$ C, and $q_2 = 5 * mu$ C are placed on the y-axis at positions $y = 3/100$ m and $y = -a*2/100$m respectively.  Take the reference potential to be zero at infinity.  
%A third point charge with charge $q_3 = -12 * mu$C is placed at $x = 4/100$ on the x-axis, as shown.  Calculate the amount of work required to assemble all three charges from infinity.
