	Suppose each \emph{Flaming Moe} costs \$1.50, and there is a cover charge of \$1.00 at the door.  Let $Y$ denote the amount of money Homer Simpson spends at the bar Then $Y = 1.50 \cdot X+1.00$.

	Tom works the night shift at a gas station on the edge of champaign.  From past experience, Tom know that 40\% of all customers who purchase gas pay at the pump with a credit card.  Assume that customers either pay at the pump with a credit card or not independently of each other. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\begin{homeworkProblem}
	A customer for a home insurance policy owns a \$200,000 home. The probability is 0.1\% that the home will be totally destroyed by fire, and the probability is 0.5\% that
the home will suffer a 50\% loss due to fire. If we ignore all other partial losses, what premium should the insurance company charge for a policy just to break even?

\begin{homeworkProblem}
	A box contains 2 green and 3 red marbles. A person draws a marble from the box at random {\bf without replacement}. If the marble drawn is red, the game stops. If it is green, the person draws again until the red marble is drawn (note that total number of marbles drawn cannot exceed 3 since there are only 2 green marbles in the box at the start). Let the random variable $X$ denote the number of {\bf green} marbles drawn.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Find the probability distribution of $X$. [ Hint: There are only 3 possible outcomes for this experiment. It would be helpful to list these three outcomes ( three possible sequences of colors of marbles drawn ). It may be helpful to make a tree diagram for this experiment. Remember that all ( three ) probabilities must add up to one. ]
			\begin{homeworkSection}{Solution}
		
			\end{homeworkSection}
		\item Suppose it costs \$5 to play the game, and the person gets \$10 for each green marble
drawn. Is the game fair * ? Explain. [ Hint: Find  $\mu_X = E(X)$, the average (expected) number of green marbles drawn per game. ]

	{\bf 2.2-4} Ina a state lottery, a three-digit integer is selected at random.  A player bets \$1 on a particular number, and if that number is selected, the payoff is \$500 - \$1 paid ofr the ticket.  Let $X$ equal the payoff to the bettor, namely, -\$1 or \$499, and find $E(X)$.
