% A metal sphere of radious $a = {a}$ m is cenetered on the origin, and carries a total charge $Q_sphere = -5 * mu$ C.  Surrounding this sphere is a spherical metal shell of inner radius $b = 3$ m and outer radious $c = 4.5$ m.  This shell is also centered on the origin, and carries a total charge $Q_shell = 2 * mu$ C.  

% 1) What is the magnitude of the electric field at a radius of $8$ m from the origin?


a = 1.5
b = 3.0
c = 4.5

Q_sphere = -5 * mu;
Q_sphere = 2 * mu;
