% (a)
% The configuration at the right shows some points around a psositive charge $Q$. If a positive test charge $q$ is placed at point $A$, at distance $r_A$ form $Q$, calculate the magnitude of the force between the charges in terms the given varibles.  
%Draw the direction of the force with an arrow on the diagram.

% (b)
% Would the magnitude of the force e bigger or smaller if the charge was placed at polints B,C, or D?
% Draw the direction of these forces on the diagram with arrows, using the lengths of the arrows to indicate the relative magnitude of the forces.

% (c) 
% On the diagram at right, draw extended electric field lines for $Q$.  What feature of these lines indicates the relative magnitude of the fields at $A$ and $B$.  

% (d)
% Calculate the magnitue fo the electric field at point $A$, in terms of given variables.
% If $Q$ is doubles, what is the new value of the electric ield at $A$?  If $q$ is doubled insted, what is the new value of the field at $A$?
